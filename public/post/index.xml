      <description>For a matrix \(A\), the notation \(A\succeq0\) and \(A\succ0\) when \(A\) is often used to denote positive semi-definite (PSD) or positive definite (PD) matrices, respectively. , we can prove that the sum of two PD matrices is also PD. A very similar approach can be used to prove the sum of two PSD matrices is also PSD.
 Let both \(A\) and \(B\) be \(d \times d\) matrices. Also, let \(A \succ 0\) and \(B \succ 0\).</description>

      <description>This post details the setup and use of latexdiff and latexpand for tracking revisions in \(\LaTeX\) documents. Revisions are tracked by first flattening \(\LaTeX\) documents (with chapters, a reference section, etc.) into a single .tex file, and then comparing the differences between an old.tex file to a new.tex file. Let me know if you notice a typo or have suggestions in the comments below.
Getting startedSince latexdiff is a Perl script, you will need Perl to run it:</description>
