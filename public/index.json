In this presentation, we will briefly introduce the EyeTrackR R package that was developed for processing and visualizing eye tracking data from people looking at scientific posters. We will then present some of our first results of a study that tries to determine where people are looking when ranking the stability of a model holding certain postures. A portable eye-tracker was used to record the original video data of the study participants looking at the human postures. We use a modified version of the Syrjala test and a Voronoi-tessellation-based approach to determine whether study participants from two different groups have similar viewing patterns of these postures.","tags":["R","Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Eye-Tracking in Practice: An Application to Human Postures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric McKinney","Jürgen Symanzik"],"categories":["Eye-Tracking"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1576886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1576886400,"objectID":"5714a6919eea731fc716aa5d5dbd015e","permalink":"/publication/jsm2019/mckinney2019b-modifications-of-the-syrjala-test-for-testing-spatial-distribution-differences-between-two-populations/","publishdate":"2019-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jsm2019/mckinney2019b-modifications-of-the-syrjala-test-for-testing-spatial-distribution-differences-between-two-populations/","section":"publication","summary":"Determining whether two spatial distributions are statistically equivalent is the goal of the Syrjala test. When using continuous bivariate data, we show that the original Syrjala test produces different results depending on the data aggregation steps. In this article, we propose modifications to the previous version of the Syrjala test and make comparisons via simulations and an application. Simulation results indicate greater power and a more appropriate type one error rate for our modified Syrjala test. Furthermore, our new approach can be used for environmental data (for which the Syrjala test was originally developed), but also for data that originates from an eye-tracking study conducted at Utah State University.","tags":["Spatial Statistics"],"title":"Modifications of the Syrjala Test for Testing Spatial Distribution Differences Between Two Populations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Teaching"],"content":"\r\r","date":1574380800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574380800,"objectID":"69b1e31a51f40c9de0a4f7eb2a5439fa","permalink":"/project/anova-applet/anova-applet/","publishdate":"2019-11-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/anova-applet/anova-applet/","section":"project","summary":"\r\r","tags":["GeoGebra"],"title":"ANOVA Applet","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["Teaching"],"content":"\rThis applet allows the user to adjust the mean and standard deviation of a normal distribution.

Moreover, most analysis methods do not provide high correlation due to the limited available test data. The aim of this paper is to use advanced statistical techniques to develop a solution to the unbonded strand stress increase problem, which phenomenological models by themselves have done poorly. In this paper, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) are employed on different sets of candidate variables, amongst the material and sectional properties from a database of Continuous unbonded tendon reinforced members in the literature. Predictions of ∆fps are made via Principal Component Regression models, and the method proposed, linear models using SPCA, are shown to improve over current models (best case R^2 of 0.27, measured-to-predicted ratio [λ] of 1.34) with linear equations. These models produced an R^2 of 0.54, 0.70 and λ of 1.03, and 0.99 for the internal and external datasets respectively.","tags":[],"title":"Prediction of Stress Increase at Ultimate in Unbonded Tendons Using Sparse Principal Component Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jürgen Symanzik","Chunyang Li","Breanna Studenka","Boyu Zhang","Eric McKinney","Brennan Bean","Melanie Athens","Madison Hansen"],"categories":["Eye-Tracking"],"content":"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","date":1541721600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541721600,"objectID":"e56d4340ff7f9c712f56cf83a5a7f9a1","permalink":"/publication/presentationtaiwan2018/eye-tracking-in-practice-the-eyetrackr-r-package-and-its-use-in-a-study-on-human-postures/","publishdate":"2018-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/presentationtaiwan2018/eye-tracking-in-practice-the-eyetrackr-r-package-and-its-use-in-a-study-on-human-postures/","section":"publication","summary":"Eye tracking has been used in many scientific fields, such as behavioral sciences, education, marketing, and sports.
