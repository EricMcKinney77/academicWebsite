abstract: "In this article, we present preliminary results of a study that tries to determine where people are looking when ranking the stability of a model holding certain postures. A portable eye-tracker is used to record the original video data of people looking at human postures. Image processing is used to extract statistical information from the video data. Visualization and the Syrjala test are used for the statistical analyses."
