abstract: "In this article, we present our first results of a study that tries to determine where people are looking when ranking the stability of an actor holding certain postures. A mobile eye-tracker is used to record the original video data of people looking at human postures. Image processing methods are employed to extract statistical information from the video data. The statistical analyses are based on visualization and machine learning approaches."
